An interpreter for a minimal [lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)).

This is a project that I made 90% for fun and 10% for a grade.
I probably won't ever implement all of the features and optimizations
I'd want, as I unfortunately don't yet posess infinite time, but
most of the basic lisp special forms are here.

## Building

```
$ cargo build     # compile both the library and the binary
$ cargo test      # run unit tests
$ cargo run       # compile and run the binary
```
